    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Crime Data Analysis Portal</strong> is a data-driven web application designed to
        visualize and analyze crime patterns using interactive dashboards.
        The project aims to help users understand trends, distributions, and variations
        in crime data across different regions and time periods.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of static reports, this platform leverages modern data visualization
        techniques to present insights in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
        Users can explore crime statistics dynamically and focus on the information
        that is most relevant to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project is developed for academic and analytical purposes and demonstrates
        the integration of data analytics tools with web technologies to support
        informed decision-making and public awareness.
    </p>

<!-- DATASET -->
<section id="dataset" class="section">
    <h2>Dataset Source</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset used in this project is sourced from <strong>Kaggle</strong>, a widely used
        open-data platform for data science and analytics.
        The dataset contains structured crime records, including attributes such as
        crime type, location, and year.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kaggle datasets are commonly used for academic projects, research, and analytical
        modeling. The data has been cleaned and processed before visualization to ensure
        clarity, accuracy, and meaningful insights.

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>

    <ul class="insights-list">
        <li>
            <strong>Crime Trends Over Time:</strong>
            The dashboard reveals noticeable variations in crime rates across different years,
            highlighting periods of increase and decline that may correlate with social,
            economic, or policy changes.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Regional Crime Distribution:</strong>
            Certain regions consistently report higher crime rates compared to others,
            indicating the need for region-specific crime prevention strategies.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Crime Type Analysis:</strong>
            Some categories of crime occur more frequently than others,
            showing patterns that can assist in prioritizing law enforcement and awareness efforts.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Comparative Insights:</strong>
            Comparing states or districts side by side helps identify outliers and
            understand how crime patterns differ geographically.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Data-Driven Decision Support:</strong>
            Interactive filters enable users to explore the data from multiple perspectives,
            supporting informed analysis rather than assumptions.
        </li>
    </ul>

<!--Objectives-->
<section id="objectives" class="section">
    <h2>Objectives & Scope</h2>

    <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
    <ul class="insights-list">
        <li>
            To analyze crime data using interactive visualizations and identify
            meaningful patterns across regions and time periods.
        </li>
        <li>
            To provide users with an intuitive platform for exploring crime statistics
            without requiring technical expertise.
        </li>
        <li>
